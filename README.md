## Text to speech is a client-server architecture fastest way to transfer text to speech

Text to speech use FPT API for convert your text to the speech , for call API we use nodejs to do that . Nodejs is a Javascript runtime very fast and strong to do everything from server-side , and it has basic syntax to do everything easier .That reason why we used that for my project .
